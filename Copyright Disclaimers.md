Copyright Disclaimers- Version 3.0 - 1/30/2025

When designing copyright disclaimers, it's essential to include clear and concise language to protect your intellectual property. For example, you might state: "Â© [2024] [Luna Hub V3]. All rights reserved. Unauthorized reproduction or distribution of this material is prohibited." Additionally, you may specify what is covered, such as images, text, and videos, and address fair use by mentioning that any use of copyrighted material must seek permission unless it falls under fair use guidelines.
